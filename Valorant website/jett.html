                <h2 class="article-title">JETT</h2>
                <p class="website-main-featured-info">Jett is one of the playable characters, or agents, in Valorant. She is a highly mobile and agile agent with a focus on speed and precision. Jett is an excellent choice for players who prefer a more aggressive playstyle, as she excels in fast-paced situations and can quickly navigate the map.
                    Jett's ultimate ability, "Blade Storm," equips her with several throwing knives that deal massive damage and can kill enemies with a single hit. If Jett is able to eliminate an enemy with a knife, her ability will be refreshed, allowing her to throw another knife and potentially wipe out the entire enemy team.
                Jett is an agile and mobile Duelist agent in the game Valorant. With her exceptional mobility and deadly precision, Jett excels at quick, aggressive plays. Her abilities allow her to swiftly navigate the battlefield, reposition herself, and eliminate enemies with style.

                Jett's primary ability is "Cloudburst," where she throws a cloud of smoke that obscures vision. This ability can be used to create cover, block enemy sightlines, and facilitate strategic movements.
                
                Her second ability, "Updraft," launches Jett into the air, granting her the ability to reach elevated positions. This skill enables her to gain advantageous angles and surprise opponents.
                
                Jett's signature ability is "Tailwind," which allows her to dash in the targeted direction. This rapid dash can be used to quickly engage or disengage from fights, making her a highly evasive agent.
                
                Finally, Jett's ultimate ability, "Blade Storm," equips her with throwing knives that deal lethal damage. These knives can be thrown individually or in rapid succession, and getting a kill with them replenishes the daggers. The ultimate ability showcases Jett's precision and lethality, making her a formidable threat in the hands of skilled players.
                
                Overall, Jett's mobility and offensive capabilities make her an excellent choice for players who prefer an aggressive playstyle, relying on speed, quick reflexes, and sharp aim to dominate their opponents in Valorant. </p>
