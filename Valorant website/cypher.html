                <h2 class="article-title">CYPHER</h2>
                <p class="website-main-featured-info">Cypher is a Sentinel agent in the tactical shooter game Valorant. He specializes in gathering information and setting up surveillance to support his team. Cypher's abilities include placing cameras to monitor areas, setting tripwires to reveal and disable enemies, deploying a remote-controlled Spycam, and using his ultimate ability, Neural Theft, to extract information from defeated enemies. Cypher is known for his ability to control the map, provide valuable intel, and deny enemy movement with his traps.
                    strategic locations on the map. When an enemy player crosses the tripwire, they are briefly immobilized and revealed to Cypher and his teammates. This ability is excellent for setting up early-warning systems and catching enemies off guard. It also forces the enemy team to proceed cautiously, creating opportunities for Cypher and his team to capitalize on.
<br> <br> 
Another powerful ability of Cypher is his Cyber Cage. He can deploy a cage-like device that obscures vision and slows down enemies who pass through it. This ability is ideal for blocking off choke points, denying entry to certain areas, and creating confusion among the enemy team. Cypher can use the Cyber Cage to cut off rotations, isolate enemies, or even force them into unfavorable positions, increasing his team's chances of success.

Furthermore, Cypher possesses a Spycam, a remote camera that he can place on any surface. This camera provides vision and audio to Cypher, allowing him to scout areas and gather crucial information about enemy positions, rotations, and strategies. The Spycam is an essential tool for Cypher players, as it enables them to coordinate with their team, make informed decisions, and execute well-coordinated attacks or defenses.
